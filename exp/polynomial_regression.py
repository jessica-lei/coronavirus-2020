class PolynomialRegression():
    def __init__(self, degree):
        """
        Implement polynomial regression from scratch.
        
        This class takes as input "degree", which is the degree of the polynomial 
        used to fit the data. For example, degree = 2 would fit a polynomial of the 
        form:

            ax^2 + bx + c
        
        Your code will be tested by comparing it with implementations inside sklearn.
        DO NOT USE THESE IMPLEMENTATIONS DIRECTLY IN YOUR CODE. You may find the 
        following documentation useful:

        https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html
        https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html

        Here are helpful slides:

        http://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/teaching/eecs349stuff/eecs349_linear_regression.pdf
    
        The internal representation of this class is up to you. Read each function
        documentation carefully to make sure the input and output matches so you can
        pass the test cases. However, do not use the functions numpy.polyfit or numpy.polval. 
        You should implement the closed form solution of least squares as detailed in slide 10
        of the lecture slides linked above.
